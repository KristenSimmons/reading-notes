My Reading Notes for Code Fellows

### ðŸ’œAbout Me ðŸ’œ
Welcome to my page! My name is Kristen Simmons. I am a single mom with 4 kids from Oklahoma City. I am a new student with Code Fellows. Real Estate and Property Management have been my main career focus up until mow. I have very little experience with computers/tech and zero experience with coding or software development. However, I am excited to expand my knowledge base and believe I am up for the challenge!
