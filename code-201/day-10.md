# Debugging & Troubleshooting JavaScript 

## 1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean! <br>
Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error. <br>


## 2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
I could probably write a short novel about all the issues I have had with debugging so far! Syntax errors are common, especially when typing quickly, or if working on a project that uses several different types of code (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc.) each with its own set of syntax rules. Simply missing one character can caue a whole mess of issues on a page. Thankfully, those errors are usually easier to catch and correct. Logic errors are much harder for me to locate, especially as a beginner developer. I can usually find where  I have gone astray with some slow, careful reading of the code. Otherwise, there are a ton of great resources online to help identify logical errors.
## 3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
Tech is always innovating and finding ways to improve. I think debugging is a topic I will have to continue to educate myself on. I think that in some ways it will become easier to debug, as we move forward with new applications and software development. At the same time, innovations and changes will bring in a new set of bugs to deal with. For me, this does not necesarily influence my long term goals. I accept this as a part of my job, just like any other job, if you want to succeed - stay informed! Never stop learning!

## 4. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints. The debugger tools can help identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly. These can be found in the developer tools section of a site. For Chrome users, this is under the "Sources" section. 

## 5. Define what a breakpoint is.
As a developer, you can add breakpoints in the code where you want to pause execution. The code will stop executing at the breakpoint and ignore everythig after. This can help to identify which section of the code your bug is in. 
## 6. What is the call stack?
This is an option in the develop tools on a site. The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
