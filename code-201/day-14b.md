# CSS Transforms, Transitions & Animations

## CSS Transforms

### 1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

A CSS transform allows developers to modify the appearance and layout of an element in various ways without affecting the element's underlying structure or affecting the layout of other elements on the page. It enables developers to perform the following transformations on an element:

Rotation: Rotate an element clockwise or counterclockwise by a specified angle.

Translation: Move an element along the X and Y axes, repositioning it relative to its original position.

Scaling: Resize an element, making it larger or smaller along the X and Y axes.

Skewing: Distort an element along the X and/or Y axes, creating a slanted or skewed appearance.

3D transformations: Apply transformations in three-dimensional space, including rotation, scaling, and translation along the X, Y, and Z axes.

CSS transforms provide a powerful tool for creating visually appealing effects, animations, and interactive elements on a website, enhancing the user experience and allowing developers to achieve complex layouts and designs with ease.

### 2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

One example of a transform that could be used on a website is image rotation. This transform allows you to rotate an image by a specified angle, which can be useful for various purposes such as displaying product images from different angles, creating visually appealing effects, or enhancing user interaction.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

### What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
A CSS transition allows developers to control the smoothness of changes to CSS properties over a specified duration. It enables developers to add effects such as fading, sliding, or changing colors to elements when certain conditions are met, such as when hovering over an element or when a class is added or removed.

### How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

CSS animations and CSS transitions are both techniques used to add motion and interactivity to web elements, but they differ in several key aspects:

Control and Triggering:

CSS Transitions: Transitions are typically triggered by changes in CSS properties, such as when a class is added or removed, or when the state of an element changes (e.g., on hover). They provide a way to smoothly transition from one state to another.
CSS Animations: Animations are more versatile and can be triggered explicitly using keyframes or by applying an animation to an element using CSS. They allow for more complex and continuous motion effects without relying on specific property changes.
Duration and Timing:

CSS Transitions: Transitions have a defined duration (set using transition-duration) and timing function (set using transition-timing-function). They interpolate between the initial and final states of the specified properties.
CSS Animations: Animations also have a duration, but they offer more control over timing by defining keyframes that specify intermediate states at different points in time. Keyframes allow for precise control over the animation's progression, including easing and pauses.
Complexity and Customization:

CSS Transitions: Transitions are generally simpler to implement and are best suited for simple effects like fading, sliding, or changing colors. They are ideal for straightforward state changes.
CSS Animations: Animations provide greater flexibility and can create more complex and dynamic effects. They allow for the creation of looping animations, multi-step transitions, and effects involving multiple properties and keyframes.
Looping and Repeating:

CSS Transitions: Transitions are not inherently designed for looping or repeating animations. They typically occur once when triggered by a change in state or property.
CSS Animations: Animations can be designed to loop infinitely or repeat a specified number of times using the animation-iteration-count property. They offer more control over the repetition and looping of animation sequences.
In summary, CSS transitions are best suited for simple state changes and property transitions triggered by user interactions or state changes, while CSS animations offer greater control and flexibility for creating complex and continuous motion effects with precise timing and keyframe-based animation sequences.
