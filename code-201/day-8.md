# CSS Flexbox & Layout

## CSS Flexbox

### 1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
Flexbox allows content to move along a main axis in one direction, either like a row or a column. It allows developers to place content layout across a single axis, either horizontally or vertically.

### 2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
In a row, the main axis would go right to left. The cross axis would be up and down. Likewise, for a column the main axis would go up and down and the crossxis would be left and right. The main axis is the main line the content is oriented with.

### 3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
Properties that reorder the visual display away from how things are ordered in the HTML document can negatively impact accessibility. The row-reverse and column-reverse values are a good example of this. The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order. This is important to understand as the logical order is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow.

## CSS Layout

## 1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?
When you use float, any elements following the floated element may have their layout adjusted. Using flexbox allows for positioning content boxes in a way that should not effect the other elements around it. 

## 2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?
This topic connects with my long term goals because this is my long term goal! I want to be in the tech industry, working alongside developers and designers. I will need to know what styling tools and elements are available to me!
