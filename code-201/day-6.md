# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## JavaScript Object Basics

### 1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

### 2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?

### 3. How do objects differ from arrays?

### 4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.

### 5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
<p>
"const dog = { <br>
  name: 'Spot', <br>
  age: 2, <br>
  color: 'white with black spots', <br>
  humanAge: function (){ <br>
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`); <br>
  } <br>
}" <br>
</p>
