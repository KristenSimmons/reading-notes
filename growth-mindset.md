### What is a growth mindset?
Your mindset is your perspective, it is the lens through which you will view life. Having a growth mindset means you are interested in the world around you and continuing to grow your experiences and knowledge. 

### Why is it important to have a growth mindsey?
Life is not always easy, it will come with challenges and obstacles. Maintaining a growth mindset will help you to overcome these challenges with more ease and enjoyment. It will help you to see new solutions and navigate difficult circumstances. 

### How can I remind myself to keep a growth mindset?
1. I like to think of where I was 5 years ago, so much has changed! Things I would never have imagined, both good and bad, have happened. Then I put the perspective into the next 5 years. Life will keep happening, but the possibilities of where I can be 5 years from now are endless! Keep going!
2. I am a mom, I have people watching me and looking up to me all the time. Even when I don't feel like I have anymore to give, I think of my children and find the motivation to keep moving forward!
3. Everyone has to start somewhere, no one is an expert right away. The only way to succeed is to learn, fail a few times, but keep putting in the effort toward success. As long as I dont give up, I can't fail!
