### Learning Markdown

#### What is Markdown and why do we use it?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to add various elements to plain text documents, such as making some words Bold or adding clickable links into a document. Markdown is used across many platforms, making markdown documents portable across many applicatons. Plain text can be changed by adding symbols to the text. For example, adding a # in front of a word, or set of words, will format those words into a Heading. Like this: "Hello my name is Kristen" "# Hello my name is Kristen"

# Heading 1 - the biggest (#) 

Adding more "#" will make the heading smaller.. like this:

## Heading 2 (##)

### Heading 3 (###)

#### Heading 4 (####)

###### Heading 6 - the smallest  (######)

Making certain words Bold or Italic is another element with Markdown. To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters. 

##### For example:

**Bold** or B**O**LD

To make text Italic, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

##### For example:

*Italic*  or It*al*ic

To add a link into text, enclose the link text in brackets (ex: [Welcome to by GitHub profile!]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (ex: (https://github.com/KristenSimmons/)).
The end result should be: <br>
[Welcome to my GitHub profile!](https://github.com/KristenSimmons/)

<p> You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with one of these 3 symbols: +, -, * <br>
For eample: (ex: * Monday, + Tuesday, - Wednesday) looks like: <br>
<ul>
  <li>Monday</li>
  <li>Tuesday</li>
  <li>Wednesday</li>
</ul>
