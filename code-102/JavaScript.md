# JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a dynamic programming language. It allows for more interactive use within software or websites. Using variable inputs, JavaScript makes it possible to have varying outputs or experiences for the user. 

## Why would we use it?

JavaScript is used in many other file types, including HTML, to add more elements into the file. For example, JavaScript allows the user to input data, which can result in various outputs. 

## What are variables in JavaScript?

Variables in Javascript are containers for storing data. The most common variables used are "let" and "const". 

## What does it mean to declare a variable?

Declaring a variable simply means to identify it. Once you use the variable in the script, it has been identified or declared. 

## What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?

In JavaScript, the = sign is considered an assignment operator. It assigns a certain value to another. For example, if we want z to represent x+y, we would assign it by typing "z = x+y"

## What is information received from the user called?

The information gained from a user is called a prompt. We can store it using variable functions.
