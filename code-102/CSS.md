# Learning CSS

## What is CSS and Why do we use it?

CSS is Cascading Style Sheets. <br>
CSS can be incorporated into an HTML file to manipulate the style and presentation of a website. CSS changes HTML from the default settings and formatting. 

## Three ways to incorporate CSS into a project:

CSS Styling can be added to a project by creating an external file within the project and linking it to the Readme file. This is done by adding a link to the CSS file on the line below the title line on the readme file. <br>
Another way to add CSS into a project is adding the CSS properties into the body section of the Readme file, this is called internal CSS. <br>
The third way to add a CSS file into a project is by adding the CSS values directly into the line of the element that you want to manipulate. 

## Exampls of using CSS for all paragraph elements:

To give all the paragraphs in a file red text, I would use the following CSS command (without the spaces):<br>
< p > { <br>
    text: color: red; <br>
} "
