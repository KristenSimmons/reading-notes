# Revisions & The Cloud

Today we learned about revising our site in VS Code and transferring those changes to our GitHub site

## 1. What is Version Control?

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. 

## 2. What is cloning in Git?

Cloning is a feature in Git that allows developers to clone their site and work remotely from their computers, then upload changes to the site after. Cloning is convenient because it allows a developer to work on their code anywhere, even without access to the internet, and not upload until they are completed with the work.

## 3. What is the command to track and stage files?

> git status <br>
This command will allow you to see what has changed since your last entry

> git add <br>
This command allows you to add changed filed to commit or staging them to commit

## 4. What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?

> git commit <br>
This command will stage the changes that you want to publish or commit to your site

## 5. What is the command to send your changed files to Github?

> git push origin main <br>
This command is used to push your commits to your site.
