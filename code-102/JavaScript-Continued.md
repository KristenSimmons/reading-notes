# JavaScipt Functions & Operators

## 1.What is control flow?

In JavaScript, Control flow refers to the order of operations. Typically, code runs in order from the first line to the last line. However, there are ways to control the flow of operations within a page. Using conditons and loops is one example of using Control Flow. Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

## 2.What is a JavaScript function?

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

## 3.What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?

A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by: <br>
1) The name of the function. <br>
2) A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas. <br>
3) The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly braces, { /* … */ }.

## 4.What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?

The parenthesis following a function will contain the parameters of the function. Parameters are essentially passed to functions by value — so if the code within the body of a function assigns a completely new value to a parameter that was passed to the function, the change is not reflected globally or in the code which called that function. <br>
When you pass an object as a parameter, if the function changes the object's properties, that change is visible outside the function.

## 5. Further Notes:

#### What are Expressions: 
At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

#### What is an assignment operator:
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = f() is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x.
